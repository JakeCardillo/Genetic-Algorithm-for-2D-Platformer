# Genetic-Algorithm-for-2D-Platformer
AI Final Project - Nick Avtges and Jake Cardillo

This is the Godot file for our game

Files containing viewable code end in .gd, these are written in GDscript, a language similar to python. 
.tscn files are files created by the game engine

The Genetic Algorithm is in Global.gd, and the player AI is in KinematicBody2D.gd
Our paper will include relevant code snippets, as well as images of the game running and our testing world

There is also a seperate file containing data from each generation
